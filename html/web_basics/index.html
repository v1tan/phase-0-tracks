<p> <strong>Saturn</strong> is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although it has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times <em>more</em> massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (â™„) represents the god's sickle.</p>

# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

A version control system allows us to track different versions of files, along with what is/has been changed, who made the change, and updates/references to problems and fixes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a separate copy of the master files where you can tinker and edit/add without messing up the master files. You would use one to test out new changes before updating the master.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you update the master files with changes you made in a separate branch. A good commit message tells another user what new changes you made exactly.


* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict happens when Git cannot consolidate multiple changes during a merge, and will usually return an error message that tells us what went wrong.
